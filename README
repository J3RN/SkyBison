Will fill out more details later, just quick and dirty README for testing.

SkyBison is a Vim plugin which expedites the usage of various cmdline commands
which take one argument.  It takes advantage of Vim's built-in
cmdline-completion to allow the user to select an argument for the command in
relatively few keystrokes.  SkyBison compares the user's input to the possible
arguments.  If only argument seems like a possible match (based on Vim's
cmdline-completion), SkyBison will automatically accept it (or propose it and
wait for the user to hit <CR>, depending on preference).

This can be compared to many buffer-management plugins, tag-management plugins,
etc, except that (1) since it takes advantage of Vim's built-in
cmdline-completion to do the heavy lifting, the code is relatively simple and
clean, and (2) it is flexible enough to work with a wide variety of Vim's
cmdline commands (as opposed to needing a plugin for every single command).

To install,  dump skybison.vim in ~/.vim/plugin (or if you use pathogen,
~/.vim/bundle/skybison/plugin/, or if you use something else, whatever that
uses)

SkyBison() is a function which takes two arguments:

The first argument (a string) should be a cmdline command (without the ":") which
itself takes an argument.  For example, "b" (to switch buffer), "tag" (to jump
to a tag), "e" (to edit a file), and "h" (help).  Anything that works with
Vim's cmdline-completion should (in theory) work.

The second argument should be either a 0 or a 1. If the second argument is 1,
SkyBison will automatically press ENTER when a single argument is found.
Otherwise, if it is 0, SkyBison will wait for the user to press ENTER.

While it can be called from the cmdline, it is probably easiest to use via
mappings.  Create mapping to call SkyBison, such as:

nnoremap <leader>b :call SkyBison("b",1)<cr>
nnoremap <leader>t :call SkyBison("tag",1)<cr>
nnoremap <leader>e :call SkyBison("e",0)<cr>
nnoremap <leader>h :call SkyBison("h",0)<cr>
