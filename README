Will fill out more details later, just quick and dirty README for testing.

To install,  dump skybison.vim in ~/.vim/plugin (or if you use pathogen,
~/.vim/bundle/skybison/plugin/, or if you use something else, whatever that
uses)

SkyBison() is a function which takes two arguments:

The first argument (a string) should be a cmdline command (without the ":") which
itself takes an argument.  For example, "b" (to switch buffer), "tag" (to jump
to a tag), "e" (to edit a file), and "h" (help).  Anything that works with
Vim's cmdline-completion should (in theory) work.

The second argument should be either a 0 or a 1. If the second argument is 1,
SkyBison will automatically press ENTER when the a single argument is found.
Otherwise, if it is 0, SkyBison will wait for the user to press ENTER.

While it can be called from the cmdline, it is probably easiest to use via
mappings.  Create mapping to call SkyBison, such as:

nnoremap <leader>b :call SkyBison("b",1)<cr>
nnoremap <leader>t :call SkyBison("tag",1)<cr>
nnoremap <leader>e :call SkyBison("e",0)<cr>
nnoremap <leader>h :call SkyBison("h",0)<cr>
